# HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE
There is a problem in hospitals to predict the patient's risk factor to give the prior treatment than the other who has less risk factor. Hence we help hospitals to identify patients of high LOS-risk (patients who will stay longer) at the time of admission. Once identified, patients with high LOS risk can have their treatment plan optimized to minimize LOS and lower the chance of staff/visitor infection. Also, prior knowledge of LOS can aid in logistics such as room and bed allocation planning. The goal is to accurately predict the Length of Stay for each patient on a case by case basis so that the Hospitals can use this information for optimal resource allocation and better functioning.
