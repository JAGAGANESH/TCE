# WATER QUALITY MONITOR (IN HOME)
Water resources play important roles in the creation of the
world. Nowadays, the water we use for both drinking and domestic
purposes isn’t a hygiene one and quality also seems bad. It is difficult
to monitor water by going to the roof of the home to check the water
tank for water purity and also can’t be done completely. So, a problem
arises on verifying water purity and its quality management.
